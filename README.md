# Discover Countries (REST)

Try it here: [Discover Countries](https://discover-countries-redsync.netlify.app)

This project was created as a challenge from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) - [REST Countries API with color theme switcher](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

## How to use?

This app shows data about all countries in the world. Home Page show all the countries fetch from [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) and some basic information about them. There is an option to serach for specific country or filter them by continent. You can click on a specific country or visit [https://discover-countries-redsync.netlify.app/country/{country-alpha3Code}] to get more information about specific country. There is also an option to change a theme color to "Dark" or "Light"

## How it works?

I've used [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to fetch information about countries and then display it on screen. There is also an option to select specific country and see more detailed infomration.
